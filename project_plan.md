## Week 1 (Dec 18-24): Understanding the Problem and Dataset

**Goals:**
- Complete a detailed review of the challenge description and dataset.
  
**DoD:** Short summary
  
- Begin developing a basic understanding of the provided sample data.
  
**DoD:** Summarize dataset attributes and insights

- Read from the previous yearâ€™s work to see what other researchers did for preprocessing.
  
**DoD:** Written summary of findings

**Status:** ON TRACK. All 3 goals completed

## Week 2 (Dec 25-31): Data Preprocessing and Exploration

**Goals:**
- Implement data loading and preprocessing scripts for both FOA and MIC formats.
  
**DoD:** Being able to load the data in and pre-process using basic data augmentations

- Investigate and/or Visualize audio data for initial insights.
  
**DoD:** Document any insights and important finds, plus visualize the data (for example: plot the spectrogram, plot the raw signal, ...)

- Read from previous year works to see what others did for training and advanced set up.
  
**DoD:** Written summary of findings

**Status:** ON TRACK. All 3 goals completed

## Week 3-4 (Jan 1-14): Model Development (Audio-only Track)

**Goals:**
- Design and use a popular network architecture for audio-only track.
- Train the model and study the outcome.

**DoD:** At least being able to replicate the baseline, and research a compatible simple model that can be used to further develop. Ultimate goal is to train on that model.

**Status:** WORK IN PROGRESSS

## Week 5-6 (Jan 15-28): Model Enhancement and Evaluation (Audio Only)

**Goals:**
- Add our own tweak to the model if works well; otherwise, implement new components if possible.
- Continue to Evaluate the audio-only model on the dev-test split.
- Experiment to see if we can train with additional data.
- Perform fine-tuning based on evaluation results.

## Week 7-8 (Jan 29-Feb 11): Documentation and Submission Preparation (Audio Only)

**Goals:**
- Document the implemented audio-only system, including model architecture and training strategies.
- Prepare submission files for the audio-only track.

## Week 9-10 (Feb 12-25): Post-Challenge Analysis (Audio Only)

**Goals:**
- Analyze challenge results for the audio-only track.
- Document lessons learned and identify potential improvements.

## Week 11-21 (Feb 26-May 15): Buffer and Final Adjustments

**Goals:**
- Use the remaining weeks as a buffer for any unexpected challenges.
- Make final adjustments, optimizations, and ensure the submission is ready well before the May 15 deadline.
